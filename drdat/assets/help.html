<h3>Distributed Real Time Data Acquisition Toolkit (DRDAT) User Guide</h3>

Drdat is a tool kit for managing studies where data entry is done by participants
using mobile devices such as smart phones. Each phone stays in contact with a web
server called the <b>Study Management Interface (SMI)</b>.

<h4>Logging in</h4>
To use DRDAT you will need a participant log in for a specific study. This information
is recorded in the SMI by the researcher who is managing the study. Once you have your
login set up you can start by downloading tasks from the SMI. To do this select the
<b>View Tasks</b> choice in the DRDAT app, enter your email and password and
click "View Tasks". Tasks will be automatically downloaded to your phone.
 
<h4>Task Notifications and Entering Data</h4>
Tasks can be scheduled in the SMI web server. When a task has a schedule it will 
automatically give you a notification when you need to do it.
<p>
To complete the task from a notification select the notification from the list 
and follow the instructions for the task. Once you are finished make sure to
press <b>Save Data</b> to save any data you have entered and upload it to the SMI 
web server. If you feel you have made a mistake just redo the task and save it. 
Unfortunately, there is no facility for deleting task data once you have uploaded 
it.
<p>
You can initiate a task at any time by selecting "View Tasks". Enter your
email and password, then select a task from the list.
<p>
You can turn off notifications. However, if you restart the phone or the DRDAT app
notifications are automatically restarted.
<p>
If the url for the SMI server changes for some reason you can change the url by 
selecting "Settings". Do not change the url unless you know what you are doing.
You can always change the url back to the default value if you make a mistake.

<h4>Clearing data</h4>
If you want to remove your data from a mobile device running DRDAT select the
<b>Delete tasks and logins</b> and <b>Delete uploaded data</b> options. Note
that the latter option will only remove data that has already been uploaded to
the SMI web server. You can manually upload the data with the <b>Upload Data to Smi</b>
option.
<p>
Alternatively, delete and reinstall the DRDAT app to remove all stored information on
the device.
